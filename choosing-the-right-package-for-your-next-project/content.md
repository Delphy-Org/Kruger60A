# Introduction

Finding the ideal package can be a daunting task, especially when there are more than 1 million NPM packages and 350 thousand PyPI packages. Just imagine for a single task, there could be 100 packages and choosing the best one can definitely be backbreaking.

On top of that, once you select a package for your project, you invest a lot of time and effort into it. So later for some reason if you have to change it, then that would a complete loss of precious time and effort.

The term 'package' also know as 'library' or 'module' means some prewritten code that you can use to some task. For example a sorting library will have code to sort numbers using different algorithms.

Selecting a package is a tedious process and requirs several steps. There are number of things to be examined, starting from popularity of a package to how well the package is maintained. In this blog, I will share several tips for choosing a package for your project and also some tools/platforms used in the industry.

## Selecting a package
### Popularity
One of the first step in choosing a package is to check its popularity. A high number of downloads means a lot of people downloaded that package. A high number of GitHub stars means a lot of people loved the repository. 

A package with high number of downloads or stars usually means a lot of people use that package and they love it.

### Open and Closed Issues/PRs
When we install a package, package bugs are definitely the last things we would want. To find whether there are bugs present in the package or not, check the number of open issues and PRs.

Usually a lot of open issues, PRs mean there are several open bugs present in the package. Always avoid libraries with huge number of open issues and PRs.

### Contributors
When there are a large number of contributors to the project, it usually means the package is stable, authentic and actively maintained. Always try to use packages when there are multiple contributors in the package.

### Maintenance
Frequently maintained packages are always a green flag. It usually means the package is stable and there is a lesser number of bugs. Also, this is an indication that future issues shall be resolved in real-time.

### Size
The size of a package is another important metric that we need to consider. Usually, packages of huge sizes can make the application especially in case of front-end web applications.

### Vulnerabilities
In recent days, open-source packages are a huge target for hackers as the scale of some high-profile packages are huge and thousands of people and other libraries depend on them. Hence, checking the number of known vulnerabilities is very important.

### Package License
Another important metric that is needed to check is the package's license. Licenses like MIT and Apache provide minimal restrictions whereas licenses like GPL and LGPL are more restrictive.

### README and good documentation
Having a good package README and documentation is crucial. It don't matter how good a project is even people can't find out how to use it or what it can do. So always check the quality of the package documentation before choosing a packkage.

### Dependencies
TODO

### Community Size
Community size is another important to check before installing a package. If you get stuck somewhere with the library then having a large community is use as there bunch of developers to help you. Also a large community for package means the package is stable, useful and, authentic.

## Tools/Platforms for analyzing packages
There are several platforms/tools to analyze a package. I'm providing a detailed list below.
### NPM
NPM or Node Package Manager 
### PyPI
### GitHub
### NPM Trends
### PyStats
### BundlePhobia and PackagePhobia
### Synk
